The festival features masked dances, music, rituals, and the unfurling of the sacred Thongdrol, which is believed to cleanse sins and bring blessings. Tshechus range from major, widely attended celebrations to smaller, remote festivals, offering visitors a vibrant and intimate glimpse into Bhutan’s rich culture, traditions, and spirituality. Likewise, Paro Tshechu is one of Bhutan’s most celebrated festivals, held annually in March or April at Paro Dzong.
